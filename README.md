# XGBoost Hypertension Predictor on AWS SageMaker

## Overview

Welcome to the XGBoost Hypertension Predictor project! This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning model developed to predict the likelihood of hypertension in patients based on various medical attributes. The model is built, trained, and deployed using AWS SageMaker, showcasing the power of cloud-based machine learning for healthcare applications.

## Project Highlights

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline:** From data collection and preprocessing to model training, optimization, and deployment.
- **AWS SageMaker Integration:** Utilized AWS SageMaker for a seamless workflow, including model training, hyperparameter tuning, and real-time deployment.
- **XGBoost Classification Model:** Leveraged the XGBoost algorithm to build a robust predictive model.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Deployed the model using SageMaker's Hosting Services to create an endpoint for real-time predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with SageMaker and S3 access
- Python 3.x
- Boto3 SDK
- SageMaker Python SDK
- XGBoost

### Installation
 **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timmtet/xgboost-hypertension-predictor.git
   cd xgboost-hypertension-predictor
   

### Usage

1. **Prepare your data:** Ensure that your dataset is in CSV format and upload it to an AWS S3 bucket.

2. **Run the Jupyter notebook:** Open the `notebooks/hypertension_model_notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter to follow the step-by-step process for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.


## Notes

- Ensure that your AWS credentials and permissions are correctly set up to access SageMaker and S3 services.
- The notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets for each stage of the machine learning pipeline.
